RLSolitaireBot
==============

This was a very simple solitaire AI bot that I created off and on while on vacation to learn more about real time screen capture, computer vision and machine learning.

The actual AI logic is very simplistic, the vacation ended before I got to use ML for the AI. It currently just follows some simple rules and is greedy, it can only play single draw, and it wins about once every 10 games -- which is better than me.

To use this you need to get the Windows 7 version of solitaire [here](http://winaero.com/blog/get-windows-7-games-for-windows-10/), and it needs to be run at maximized 1080p.

The number one thing that I learned while creating this is just how much of a pain in the ass trying to do this in C# was.
